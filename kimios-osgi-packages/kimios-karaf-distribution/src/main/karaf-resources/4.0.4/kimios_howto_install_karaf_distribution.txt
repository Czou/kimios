HowTo Kimios Bundle installation

Kimios bundle is a ready-to-launch Kimios application launched within a Apache Tomcat instance.

Requirements:
1) Java 8
To check which java version is installed, go to the shell and type:
java -version
If necessary, you can download Java 8 from java.com.
2) A running object-relational database system instance from this list: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server.
We advise you to use PostgreSQL database system.
The data schema will be created only if it does not exist yet. 

Installation:
1) Unarchive the file (.tar.gz or .zip) at the location you want to install Kimios
2) Go in the directory (name starting with 'kimios-karaf-distribution-').
3) You have now to configure a few things before launching Kimios Karaf distribution.
You have to edit a file, according to your operating system:
  - Windows: bin\setenv.bat
  - Linux: bin/setenv

You must set these variables
  - KIMIOS_JDBC_URL: database instance
  - KIMIOS_JDBC_USER: database user
  - KIMIOS_JDBC_PASSWORD: database password
  - KIMIOS_REPO_PATH: repository path (for files put in Kimios)
  - KIMIOS_REPO_TMP_PATH: temporary repository path
  
For the 2 following variables, please use just one of them.
If you want Kimios to internally manage Solr instance, use this variable:
  - KIMIOS_SOLR_HOME: embedded Solr repository path
If you want to manage your own Solr instance, use this:
  - KIMIOS_SOLR_SERVER_URL: external Solr url

4) First launch
Go in shell and type, according to your operating system:
  - Windows: bin\karaf.bat
  - Linux: bin/karaf

5) Configuration
During first launch, Kimios will create configuration files:
  - for Kimios server: etc/org.kimios.server.app.cfg
  - for Kimios Web Client: etc/org.kimios.client.app.cfg

To change configuration, you can modify these files and restart Kimios by going to the console. Type 'shutdown' and confirm by 'yes'.
